# Monte Carlo & Financial Programming Workshop 💹

This repository contains the code I presented as a **Tech Lead at GeeksforGeeks (MIT-ADT University)** during our **Financial Programming Workshop**.  
I explained concepts like the **Law of Large Numbers** and **Monte Carlo Simulation** for financial modeling, along with Python visualization for better understanding.
